The game can be in one of two major modes at any time - 'moving & rolling' or 'suggesting'.

When you're in moving & rolling the player can do 5 things:
- end their turn
- roll dice
- move around the board
- make a suggestion
- make an accusation

When the player makes a suggestion the mode changes to 'suggesting'. In this mode you can do 2 things:
- pass on the suggestion if you can't refute it
- refute a specific part of the suggestion

You leave suggesting either when everyone has passed or when someone refutes the suggestion.
