Implementation of Cluedo.


5. I saw someone stealing your art! 
Kindly ask them to link to me if they haven't. 
Other than that, don't worry, I probably don't mind.

4. Can I use/sell the dolls for adoptables/prints/avatars? 
Yes, but please link back to the game you used. However, if the game doesn't have a 
DollDivine link inside, it was made by someone else and you need to contact them for 
permission.
